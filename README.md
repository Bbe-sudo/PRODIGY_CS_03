# PRODIGY_CS_03
Cyber Security Internship Task 3 – Prodigy InfoTech

## Task Overview:

Create a Python program that assesses the strength of a password based on specific security criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
The program analyzes the input password, provides feedback on missing elements, and classifies the overall strength as Weak, Medium, Strong, or Very Strong.

## Features
- Detects weak, medium, strong, and very strong passwords
- Gives feedback on missing criteria
- Uses regular expressions for validation  

## Tools Used
 Python 3
 Regular Expressions

 ## What I Learned
- How to use regular expressions (re module) to validate text patterns in Python.
- The importance of password complexity in protecting systems from brute-force or dictionary attacks.
- How to provide user feedback effectively for security-related tools.
- 
## Output 
<pre> ```=== Password Strength Checker ===
Enter your password: Vanilla20

Password Strength: 🔒 Strong
Feedback:
- ❌ Include at least one special character (!, @, #, $, etc.)``` </pre>
